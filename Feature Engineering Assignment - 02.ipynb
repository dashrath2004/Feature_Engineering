    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS : \n",
    "\n",
    "The filter method is a type of feature selection technique that uses statistical tests to evaluate the relevance of each feature independently of the machine learning algorithm being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter method works by ranking each feature based on a certain criteria or score, and then selecting the top-ranked features as the final set of features for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter method typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Compute a relevance score for each feature\n",
    "2.Rank the features based on their relevance score\n",
    "3.Select the top-ranked features"
